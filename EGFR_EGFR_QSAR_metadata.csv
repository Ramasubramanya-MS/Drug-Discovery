Kinase activity was determined with time-resolved Fret (TR-FRET) assay (LanthaScreen® kinase activity assay, from InVitrogen).2) The assay is performed in a Black 384-well plate (from Corning). The kinase and the compound was incubated for 30 mM at room temperature. ATP (1 mM) and fluorescein-poly GT were added, and the reaction was incubated for 15 mM. Detection agent SA-XL665 (from Cisbio Assay) and TK Ab-Cryptate detection antibody (from InVitrogen) were added to stop the reaction.3) The 384-well plate was sealed and incubated for 1 hour.

Staurosporine was used as a reference molecule (or referred to as a positive control). The kinase inhibitory activities of the tested compounds were expressed in the IC50 value (half inhibition concentration) or the kinase activity inhibitory rate by the tested compounds at 10 uM.

In this assay, an isotopic labeling method was used to label the gamma phosphate group on ATP. EGFR (including wild type, L858R mutant type and L858R/T790M double mutant type), VEGFR2, ALK, BTK, c-KIT, c-SRC, MET, PDGFRalpha and FLT3 kinases were tested in vitro for the activity inhibition. Staurosporine was used as a reference molecule (or referred to as a positive control). The kinase inhibitory activities of the tested compounds were expressed in the IC50 value (half inhibition concentration) or the kinase activity inhibitory rate by the tested compounds at 10 uM. The IC50 value can be obtained by the calculation of the inhibitory rates at a series of different concentrations of the tested compounds. 1. Materials:  20mM 3-(N-morpholinyl)propylsulfonic acid (MOPS);  1mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA);  0.01% Polyethylene glycol lauryl ether (Brij-35)."

In this assay, an isotopic labeling method was used to label the gamma phosphate group on ATP. EGFR (including wild type, L858R mutant type and L858R/T790M double mutant type), VEGFR2, ALK, BTK, c-KIT, c-SRC, MET, PDGFRalpha and FLT3 kinases were tested in vitro for the activity inhibition. Staurosporine was used as a reference molecule (or referred to as a positive control). The kinase inhibitory activities of the tested compounds were expressed in the IC50 value (half inhibition concentration) or the kinase activity inhibitory rate by the tested compounds at 10 uM. The IC50 value can be obtained by the calculation of the inhibitory rates at a series of different concentrations of the tested compounds. 1.

EGFR (including wild type, L858R mutant type and L858R/T790M double mutant type), VEGFR2, ALK, BTK, c-KIT, c-SRC, MET, PDGFRalpha and FLT3 kinases were tested in vitro for the activity inhibition. Staurosporine was used as a reference molecule (or referred to as a positive control). The kinase inhibitory activities of the tested compounds were expressed in the IC50 value (half inhibition concentration) or the kinase activity inhibitory rate by the tested compounds at 10 uM. The IC50 value can be obtained by the calculation of the inhibitory rates at a series of different concentrations of the tested compounds. 1. Materials:  20mM 3-(N-morpholinyl)propylsulfonic acid (MOPS);  1mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA);  0.01% Polyethylene glycol lauryl ether (Brij-35)."

The general procedures of the assay are given as follows: The cancer cells A431 that highly expressing EGFR (Institute of biochemistry and cell biology) were chosen and seeded to 96-well cell culture plate at a suitable concentration (e.g., 5000 cells/mL medium). The cells then were incubated in carbon dioxide (CO2) incubator until they reached 85% confluency. Then, the cell culture medium was replaced by fresh one with tested compounds added in it at serial concentrations (general 6 to 7 concentrations). Then the cells were put back to the incubator and cultured continuously. 72 hours later, the activity of the tested compounds for inhibiting the cell proliferation was determined by using Sulforhodamine B (SRB) method."

In this assay, an isotopic labeling method was used to label the gamma phosphate group on ATP. EGFR (including wild type, L858R mutant type and L858R/T790M double mutant type), VEGFR2, ALK, BTK, c-KIT, c-SRC, MET, PDGFRalpha and FLT3 kinases were tested in vitro for the activity inhibition. Staurosporine was used as a reference molecule (or referred to as a positive control). The kinase inhibitory activities of the tested compounds were expressed in the IC50 value (half inhibition concentration) or the kinase activity inhibitory rate by the tested compounds at 10 uM. The IC50 value can be obtained by the calculation of the inhibitory rates at a series of different concentrations of the tested compounds. 1. Materials:  20mM 3-(N-morpholinyl)propylsulfonic acid (MOPS);  1mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA);  0.01% Polyethylene glycol lauryl ether (Brij-35)."

In this assay, an isotopic labeling method was used to label the gamma phosphate group on ATP. EGFR (including wild type, L858R mutant type and L858R/T790M double mutant type), VEGFR2, ALK, BTK, c-KIT, c-SRC, MET, PDGFRalpha and FLT3 kinases were tested in vitro for the activity inhibition. Staurosporine was used as a reference molecule (or referred to as a positive control). The kinase inhibitory activities of the tested compounds were expressed in the IC50 value (half inhibition concentration) or the kinase activity inhibitory rate by the tested compounds at 10 uM. The IC50 value can be obtained by the calculation of the inhibitory rates at a series of different concentrations of the tested compounds. 1.

The entire assay was conducted in accordance with EGFR PTK inhibitor cellular activity test S.O.P.A typical kinase inhibition reaction requires a protein tyrosine kinase, a suitable buffer solution system, a peptide substrate and ATP. In the present EGFR tyrosine kinase assay, a buffer solution system containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM MnCl2; 50 uM Na3VO4; 50 ng/10 ul EGFR (Proquinase); 100 uM ATP; and 10 ng/ml poly(Glu, Tyr) (4:1, Sigma) as a substrate were used.First, 10 ul of EGFR was added to each well of a 96-well plate, 10 ul of the test compounds diluted as described in Test Example 2 (Examples 1 to 173) was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The compounds of Test Example 1 were used as control compounds at a concentration of 0.0001 to 10 uM."
